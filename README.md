This is a collaborative space to record discussions and details from a series of online meetings called LFD Around the World. This virtual meetup was a follow-up of the [Frontiers in Biological Fluorescence 2024](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/frontiers/), a symposium celebrating **Enrico Gratton**'s retirement and 38 years of the [**Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics**](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/). The goal is to compile key takeaways and action items for future reference. We use FLIM as the main example because of ongoing efforts by multiple groups from LFD.

### Main Discussion Topics

- **Data Formats and Compatibility || Standardizing Data Formats**:  How can we standardize data formats to ensure compatibility across different fluorescence/FLIM software tools? What are the best practices for embedding metadata to enhance reproducibility? There is still a need to establish a universally accepted data format for FLIM data to ensure compatibility and ease of use across  different software tools.

- **Algorithm Development || Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) || Maintaining Open-Source Software:** How can we balance simplicity and functionality in GUIs to make complex analyses accessible to non-experts? What are the most important features to include in a GUI for FLIM analysis? Balancing Simplicity and Functionality in GUIs. Designing GUIs that are both user-friendly for non-experts and powerful enough for  advanced users is an ongoing challenge. How to secure funding and resources for the long-term maintenance and development of open-source  software remains a significant   challenge. How can we integrate new algorithms into existing libraries like PhasorPy? What are the best approaches for developing and testing new algorithms for phasor analysis?

- **Reproducibility || Robust Recording and Reporting**: How can we ensure that analysis steps are recorded and reported to enhance reproducibility? What are the best methods for standardizing analysis procedures and documenting them? Developing robust methods for recording and reporting analysis steps to ensure reproducibility is a work in progress.

- **Community Engagement:** Encouraging more contributions from the community and ensuring that these contributions are effectively integrated into existing projects is important. The role of forums and groups such as [[image.sc](http://image.sc)]([https://forum.image.sc/](https://forum.image.sc/)), [QUAREP-LIMI]([https://quarep.org/](https://quarep.org/)) , [microscopy-db]([https://microscopydb.io/](https://microscopydb.io/)), [BINA]([https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/)), [GloBIAS]([https://www.globias.org/](https://www.globias.org/)) are all invaluable. These platforms serve as hubs for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and networking within the scientific community. Ultimately, fostering a culture of open communication and collaboration through these platforms is our goal
