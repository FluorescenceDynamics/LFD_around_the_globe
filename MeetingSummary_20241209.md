## Key Points Discussed
### Introduction and Purpose
The meeting is aimed to share updates on Fluorescence/FLIM software projects, discuss challenges, and explore potential collaborations.
### Current Projects and Updates: 		
- **Flute**: A Python-based FLIM analysis tool with a graphical user interface (GUI). Future plans include direct import of various file formats, wavelet filters, and advanced features for metabolic imaging.
- **PhasorPy**: A library for phasor analysis in FLIM and spectral imaging. It supports multiple file formats and provides extensive documentation and tutorials. Future developments include implementing more functionalities and improving user interface.
- **Napari Super-Res**: A plugin for Napari that integrates phasor analysis for spectral and lifetime data. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for complex analyses.
### Discussions
- **Data Formats**: The need for standardized data formats to ensure compatibility and reproducibility. The use of OME-TIFF and other formats was discussed.
- **Reproducibility**: Emphasis on recording macros or steps taken during analysis to ensure reproducibility. Suggestions included embedding metadata and using standardized formats.
- **Community Contributions**: Encouragement for community involvement in developing and maintaining open-source FLIM software. Contributions can include code development, error reporting, and providing new data formats.
- **Workshops and Training**: The importance of workshops and training sessions to disseminate knowledge and gather feedback from users. Past workshops were highlighted, and future events were planned.
- **Algorithm Development**: Focus on developing new algorithms for phasor analysis and integrating them into existing tools.
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**: The need for intuitive GUIs to make complex analyses accessible to non-experts. Discussions on how to balance simplicity and functionality.
- **Quality Control**: Participation in international working groups like QUAREP-LiMi to establish standards and guidelines for FLIM data acquisition and analysis.
## Action Items
- *Compile a List of FLIM Tools*: Create a comprehensive list of available FLIM tools, categorized by GUI and library functionalities. This is to foreshadow fluorescence tools.
- *Standardize Data Formats*: Work towards standardizing data formats and ensuring compatibility across different software.
- *Enhance Reproducibility*: Implement features to record analysis steps and embed metadata for reproducibility.
- *Community Engagement Assessment*: Encourage more community contributions and participation in workshops and training sessions.

**Next Meeting Date**: March 10th | Agenda: Updates on ongoing projects, discussion on standardizing data formats, and planning for future workshops and collaborations.
