# 2024 December 09 Meeting
## Key Points Discussed
### Introduction and Purpose
The meeting is aimed to share updates on Fluorescence/FLIM software projects, discuss challenges, and explore potential collaborations.
### Current Projects and Updates: 		
- **Flute**: A Python-based FLIM analysis tool with a graphical user interface (GUI). Future plans include direct import of various file formats, wavelet filters, and advanced features for metabolic imaging.
- **PhasorPy**: A library for phasor analysis in FLIM and spectral imaging. It supports multiple file formats and provides extensive documentation and tutorials. Future developments include implementing more functionalities and improving user interface.
- **Napari Super-Res**: A plugin for Napari that integrates phasor analysis for spectral and lifetime data. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for complex analyses.
### Discussions
- **Data Formats**: The need for standardized data formats to ensure compatibility and reproducibility. The use of OME-TIFF and other formats was discussed.
- **Reproducibility**: Emphasis on recording macros or steps taken during analysis to ensure reproducibility. Suggestions included embedding metadata and using standardized formats.
- **Community Contributions**: Encouragement for community involvement in developing and maintaining open-source FLIM software. Contributions can include code development, error reporting, and providing new data formats.
- **Workshops and Training**: The importance of workshops and training sessions to disseminate knowledge and gather feedback from users. Past workshops were highlighted, and future events were planned.
- **Algorithm Development**: Focus on developing new algorithms for phasor analysis and integrating them into existing tools.
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**: The need for intuitive GUIs to make complex analyses accessible to non-experts. Discussions on how to balance simplicity and functionality.
- **Quality Control**: Participation in international working groups like QUAREP-LiMi to establish standards and guidelines for FLIM data acquisition and analysis.
## Action Items
- *Compile a List of FLIM Tools*: Create a comprehensive list of available FLIM tools, categorized by GUI and library functionalities. This is to foreshadow fluorescence tools.
- *Standardize Data Formats*: Work towards standardizing data formats and ensuring compatibility across different software.
- *Enhance Reproducibility*: Implement features to record analysis steps and embed metadata for reproducibility.
- *Community Engagement Assessment*: Encourage more community contributions and participation in workshops and training sessions.

**Next Meeting Date**: March 10th | Agenda: Updates on ongoing projects, discussion on standardizing data formats, and planning for future workshops and collaborations.

### Minutes
**Thorsten** proposed creating a centralized website to host open-source software developed by various labs. This platform would simplify access to these tools by offering easy installers and clear documentation. He also suggested developing a standardized data format to ensure compatibility across different software, facilitating data translation between tools.Christoph highlighted the needÂ for libraries like Phasorpy and its support for multiple file formats and integration with other open-source tools. **Christoph** stressed the importance of a robust, well-documented library for the community and shared ongoing efforts to enhance functionality and usability. **Jenu** emphasized the need for a centralized platform for FLIM software tools, which should include both graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and libraries. He discussed challenges in maintaining open-source software and the importance of community involvement and funding. Jenu also stressed the need for reproducibility in research, standardized data formats, and metadata recording. **Adan** presented progress on the Napari SuperS project, which integrates various super-resolution methods into a single platform. He stressed the importance of open-source ecosystems and standardized data formats for improved accessibility and reproducibility. Adan also highlighted challenges in Latin America, particularly related to data management and infrastructure. **Alex** shared a MATLAB-based FLIM analysis tool designed for biologists, featuring a GUI and capabilities like phasor analysis, clustering, and unmixing. He emphasized the importance of intuitive tools for non-experts and expressed interest in contributing to the PhasorPy project by integrating some of the developed functionalities. The tool is available on Figshare and Github now. **Michelle** provided an update on the recent LFD workshop, which had 42 attendees and 13 sponsors. She highlighted the success of hands-on training sessions and lectures. Michelle also discussed the challenges in securing funding for the LFD resource center and the need to reconsider strategies for its future support. **Leonel** discussed the development of PhasorPy, a Python library for phasor analysis in FLIM and spectral imaging. He highlighted its comprehensive documentation and the importance of community contributions. Leonel emphasized the potential for integrating PhasorPy with other GUIs to improve usability and enhance performance. **Chiara** presented the FLIM analysis tool, Flute, which features a user-friendly GUI. She highlighted its capabilities, including phasor analysis, batch processing, and interactive plotting. Chiara emphasized the importance of making FLIM analysis accessible to non-experts and called for community feedback to further develop the tool. **Elizabeth, Abhishek, Bruno, Bruno, Alessandro, Guilia** and others raised important discussion points and participated in the chat.
